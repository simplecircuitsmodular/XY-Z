# XY-Z

This is a 16 step 2 dimensional CV sequencer. Each step is controlled by a potentiometer. The pots are laid out in a 4x4 grid, and 2 inputs (X and Y) allow you to move between rows and columns. The module is based on an ATMega 328 and is programed via the Arduino IDE.

## Files
### XY-Z_xx .brd and .sch
These are the board and schematic files needed to manufacture PCBs. Gerbers need to be generated in Eagle for manufacturing.

### XY-Z_xx.md
These are the parts lists for each module. A mouser BOM is available in this file as well.

### XY-Z.ai
These are the panels in Adobe Illustrator format. I make my panels on a laser cutter with 1/8 inch acrylic.

### XY-Z_xx.ino
This is the Arduino source code for the module. It can be uploaded using an ISP programmer.

## Updates

### 01 07OCT19
